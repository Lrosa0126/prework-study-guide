# prework-study-guide


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation for creating this Prework study guide was my family. While this is something very drastic, they motivated me to take steps into bettering myself and putting myself in a position in which I would be creating this webpage. I built this project and expanded on it so that my journey through my coding adventure would be a smoother process, and so that I could learn new things.
This project solves the problem of having a study guide to reference back to, and expand on. Ontop of it, it becomes a tool for me to use in the future, so that if I ever forget, or run into a problem, I have somewhere that I can reference back to.
Through this excercise I learned the basics of coding, starting from absolutely nothing. I had no prior experience with coding, and this project has taught me enough to be able to create a website study guide, and a github.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
